# Welcome to Metakicks NFT Project!

## [ DESCRIPTION ]
Metakicks is a shoe-focused NFT art project completed for a client as a proof-of-concept for similar launches in the future. It features a collection of 100 generative 2D NFTs (also produced programmatically by Energy On Chain), an interactive front end, and smart contracts deployed live on Polygon blockchain. The project will officially launch in summer 2022 and will be featured at a live blockchain meetup event at a local brewery.
